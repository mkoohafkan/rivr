Introduction
------------

This vignette documents the mathematical derivations for
gradually-varied and unsteady flow analysis with `rivr`. All derivations are 
based on [Chaudry (2007)][id]. In Section 1,
important definitions related to channel geometry are discussed. In Section 2, 
basic concepts of open-channel flow are discussed and one-dimensional 
shallow-water equations are derived. In Section 3, gradually-varied 
flow is derived and the standard-step method is discussed. In Section 4, the 
kinematic and dynamic wave models for simulating unsteady flow are derived along 
with the three discretization methods available in `rivr`. Finally, Section 5 
discusses the Method of Characteristics and its application to boundary 
conditions of unsteady flow simulations.

Section 1: Channel geometry relations
-------------------------------------

![](channeldiagram.png "Cross-section of a trapezoidal channel.")

A channel is *prismatic* if it has the same slope and cross-section throughout 
its entire length. The `rivr` package currently supports prismatic trapezoidal 
channels of arbitrary bottom width $B$ and side slope $SS = H:V$. Given a flow
depth $y$, the flow area is then
$$
A = By + SSy^2
$$
Another important definition is the wetted perimeter $P$, which for a 
trapezoidal cross-section is
$$
P = B + 2y\sqrt{1 + SS^2}
$$ 
The hydraulic radius is the ratio of the cross-sectional flow area to the 
wetted perimeter, i.e.
$$
R = \frac{A}{P}
$$
The hydraulic depth $D$ is defined as the ratio of the cross-sectional flow 
area to the top width $T$, where
$$
T = \frac{dA}{dy}
$$
which for a trapezoidal cross-section yields
$$
T = B + 2ySS
$$
and
$$
D = \frac{A}{T} = \frac{By + SSy^2}{B + 2ySS}
$$
Finally, the term $\bar{y}$ is related to hydrostatic pressure and is defined 
as the distance from the water surface to the centroid of the cross-sectional 
flow area, i.e.
$$
\bar{y} = \frac{2B + T}{3(B + T)} y
$$

The definitions described above are fundamental properties related to
one-dimensional open-channel flow. These relations (and their derivatives) are 
used extensively in the following sections to derive important flow relations 
and appear repeatedly in numerical solution schemes.

Section 2: Basic concepts of one-dimensional open-channel flow
--------------------------------------------------------------

The flow depth of a channel in an equilibrium state is called the 
*normal depth*, i.e. the flow depth at which 
gravitational forces (bed slope) are balanced by friction forces 
(bed roughness). The `rivr` package expresses the normal depth via the 
semi-empirical Manning's equation
$$
Q = \frac{C_m}{n} AR^{2/3}S_0^{1 / 2}
$$
where $Q$ is the channel flow, $S_0$ is the channel slope, $A$ is the 
cross-sectional flow area, $R$ is the hydraulic depth and $C_m$ is a conversion 
factor based on the unit system used (1.49 in US customary units and 1.0 
in SI units). The expression is often rewritten as 
$$
Q = KS_0^{1 / 2}
$$
Where $K$ is the *channel conveyance*. The normal depth $y_n$ factors into the 
expressions of both $A$ and $R$ (i.e. $K$) and the above equation cannot be 
rearranged to solved explicitly for the normal depth; an implicit (iterative) 
solution is needed. The univariate Netwon-Raphson method is often used to 
provide efficient and precise solutions for $y_n$. Generally, the 
Newton-Raphson method is defined as 
$$
x = x^* - \frac{f(x^*)}{\frac{df}{dx}\bigg|_{x^*}}
$$
where $x$ is the updated guess for the parameter for which a solution is 
sought, $x^*$ is the prior guess for the parameter value, $f(x)$ is a
zero-valued function of the parameter and $\frac{df}{dx}$ is the derivative 
of said function. To apply the Newton-Raphson method here, Manning's equation 
is rewritten as
$$
f(y_n) = AR^{2/3} - \frac{nQ}{C_m S_0^{1 / 2}} = 0
$$
and its derivative is
$$
\frac{df}{dy_n} = \frac{5}{3}T R^{2/3} - \frac{2}{3}R^{5/3}\frac{dP}{dy_n}
$$
where $\frac{dP}{dy_n} = 2\sqrt{1 + SS^2}$. A related concept is the 
*critical depth*, the flow depth which 
minimizes the specific energy of the flow. The specific energy is the sum of 
flow depth and velocity head, i.e.
$$
E = y + \frac{u^2}{2g} = \frac{1}{2g}\left(\frac{Q}{A}\right)^2
$$
where $u$ is the uniform flow velocity. The critical depth is then the flow 
depth that satisfies
$$
\frac{dE}{dy} = 0 = 1 - \frac{Q^2}{gA^3}\frac{dA}{dy} = 1 - \frac{Q^2 T}{gA^3}
$$
For a trapezoidal channel it can be mathematically proved that only one 
critical depth exists for a given flow rate. The critical depth can be solved 
using the Newton-Raphson method with $f(y_c) = \frac{dE}{dy} = 0$ and
$$
\frac{df}{dy_c} = \frac{3}{2}\left(AT\right)^{1 / 2} - \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{A}{T}\right)^{3/2}\frac{dT}{dy_c}
$$
where $\frac{dT}{dy_c} = 2SS$ for a trapezoidal channel. The critical depth is
also the depth at which the *Froude number* of the flow is unity; the Froude 
number is a dimensionless measure of bulk flow characteristics that represents 
the relative importance of inertial forces and gravitational forces and is 
defined as
$$
Fr = \frac{Q}{A\sqrt{gD}}
$$

Flows are referred to as *subcritical* if the flow depth is greater than the 
critical depth ($Fr < 1$) and *supercritical* if the flow depth is less than the 
critical depth ($Fr > 1$). Flows can transition gradually from subcritical to 
supercritical conditions; when the rate of variation of flow depth is small 
with respect to the longitudinal distance over which the change occurs, the 
river state is referred to as *gradually-varied flow*. In contrast, 
the transition from supercritical to subcritical conditions occur abruptly in 
the form of a hydraulic jump and is an example of *rapidly-varied flow*. Both
gradually-varied and rapidly-varied flows can be either steady (flow is 
constant through time) or unsteady (flow rate varies with respect to time). The 
`rivr` package provides solutions for steady gradually-varied and unsteady 
flow problems.


Section 3: Solutions to steady gradually-varied flow problems
-------------------------------------------------------------

The *standard-step method* can be used to solve the steady gradually-varied flow 
profile when the channel flow and geometry are known. Additionally, the flow 
depth $y$ must be known at a specified channel cross-section; this 
cross-section is referred to as the *control section* and the flow depth 
associated with the channel flow rate $Q$ at the control section is $y_1$. The 
total head $H_1$ at the control section is the sum of the elevation head, flow 
depth head, and velocity head, i.e.
$$
H_1 = y_1 + z_1 + \frac{1}{2g}\left(\frac{Q}{A_1}\right)^2 = z_1 + E_1
$$
where $z_1$ is the elevation of the 
control section bottom relative to some datum and $A_1$ is the cross-sectional 
flow area at the control section. From conservation of energy, it follows that 
the total head $H_2$ at some downstream cross-section, referred to as the 
*target section*, is
$$
H_2 = H_1 - h_f
$$
where $h_f$ is the head loss. While the head loss term generally combines both 
friction loss and form drag, the latter component is neglected by `rivr`. The 
friction component is expressed as the average friction slope between the 
control and target sections:
$$
h_f = \frac{{S_f}_1 + {S_f}_2}{2} \left(x_2 - x_1\right)
$$
where $x_2 - x_1$ is the longitudinal distance between the control and target 
section. Note that the sign of $h_f$ therefore depends on whether the control 
section is upstream ($x_1 < x_2$) or downstream ($x_1 > x_2$) of the target 
section. Substituting these terms into the governing equation and rearranging 
yields
$$
y_2 + z_2 + \frac{1}{2g}\left(\frac{Q}{A_2}\right)^2 + \frac{{S_f}_1 + {S_f}_2}{2} \left(x_2 - x_1\right) = y_1 + z_1 + \frac{1}{2g}\left(\frac{Q}{A_1}\right)^2
$$
Note that all terms on the right-hand side of the equation are known, while 
$A_2$ and ${S_f}_2$ on the left-hand side of the equation are functions of 
$y_2$. Transposing all terms to the left-hand side yields a zero-value function 
of $y_2$:
$$
f(y_2) = 0 = y_2 + z_2 + \frac{1}{2g}\left(\frac{Q}{A_2}\right)^2 + \frac{{S_f}_1 + {S_f}_2}{2} \left(x_2 - x_1\right) - y_1 - z_1 - \frac{1}{2g}\left(\frac{Q}{A_1}\right)^2
$$ 
This function is suitable for solving using the Newton-Raphson method discussed 
previously, i.e.
$$
y_2 = y_2^* - \frac{f(y_2^*)}{\frac{df}{dy}\bigg|_{y_2^*}}
$$
where
$$
\frac{df}{dy_2} = 1 - \frac{Q^2}{gA_2^3}\frac{dA_2}{dy_2} + \frac{1}{2}\left(x_2 - x_1\right) \frac{d{S_f}_2}{dy_2}
$$
and
$$
\frac{d{S_f}_2}{dy} = -2\left(\frac{{S_f}_2}{A} \frac{dA}{dy} + \frac{2}{3} \frac{{S_f}_2}{R} \frac{dR}{dy} \right)
$$
Once the 
flow depth at the target section is found, the target section becomes the new 
control section and the flow depth at the next target section is computed, with
the algorithm "stepping" up or down the channel to a specified distance from 
the initial control section. The standard-step method is accessed via the 
function `compute_profile`. 


Section 4: Solutions to unsteady-flow problems
----------------------------------------------

Unsteady flow problems are generally characterized using the Shallow Water 
Equations, with the one-dimensional form expressed as
$$
\frac{\partial A}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial Q}{\partial x} = 0
$$
$$
\frac{\partial Q}{\partial t} + \frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left(Qu + g\bar{y}A\right) - gA\left(S_0 - S_f\right) = 0
$$ 
where the first equation expresses mass conservation and the second expresses 
momentum conservation. Without further simplification, these equations are 
often referred to as the Dynamic Wave Model (DWM). The Kinematic Wave Model 
(KWM) refers to a simplification of the momentum equation by assuming 
$S_0 = S_f$, i.e. the momentum equation is instead expressed through the 
relation
$$
A = \left( \frac{nQP^{2/3}}{C_m S_0^{1 / 2}} \right)^{3/5}
$$
Both the KWM and DWM can be solved using numerical discretization methods such 
as finite-difference schemes. Finite-difference schemes discretize a continuous 
model domain into a series of *nodes* separated by an incremental distance 
$\Delta x$. The model time domain is similarly discretized into a series of 
time steps separated by an incremental time $\Delta t$. A finite-difference 
scheme is called *explicit* if the value of the variable being solved for on 
time step $k + 1$ depends explicitly on the value of the variable at the 
previous time step $k$. Explicit methods are advantageous because they are 
easier to program and implement, but are disadvantageous because they are 
subject to stability constraints. The stability constraint is defined by the 
Courant number
$$
C = \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x} u
$$
which represents the ratio of the flow velocity to the rate of propagation of 
information through the model domain. The numerical solution is unstable if 
$C > 1$.

The `rivr` package provides an interface to one 
finite-difference numerical scheme for the KWM and two finite-difference 
schemes for the DWM. In addition, the DWM interface supports boundary 
condition solutions using the Method of Characteristics (MOC). These schemes 
are accessed via the function `route_wave` and their derivations are discussed 
below.

### Solution to the Kinematic Wave Model

The KWM finite-difference scheme implemented in `rivr` requires a 
constant time step and spatial resolution, a known  upstream boundary condition 
(flow) for the full simulation time, and an initial condition (flow) at every 
node. The initial water depth, flow area, and flow velocity are calculated from 
the channel geometry relations, with the initial water depth assumed to be the 
normal depth. At the initiation of a new time step $k + 1$, the flow at the 
upstream boundary node $i = 1$ is assigned from the user-supplied boundary 
condition. The flow depth at the upstream boundary is calculated as the normal 
depth for that flow, i.e.
$$
y_1^{k+1} = y_n\left(Q_1^{k+1}\right) 
$$ 
where the superscripts denote the timestep. The flow at a downstream node $i$
is computed as
$$
Q_i^{k+1} = Q^{k+1}_{i - 1} - \frac{\Delta x}{\Delta t}\left( A_{i-1}^{k+1} - A_{i-1}^{k}\right)
$$
where the subscripts denote the node. The flow depth at node $i$ is calculated
using a Newton-Raphson formulation where
$$
f(y_i^{k+1}) = 0 = A_i^{k+1} - \left(\frac{nQ_i^{k+1}}{C_m S_0^{1 / 2}}\right)^{3/5} \left(P_i^{k+1}\right)^{2/5} 
$$  
and
$$
\frac{df}{dy_i^{k+1}} = \frac{dA}{dy}\bigg|_{y_i^{k+1}} - \frac{2}{5}\frac{dP}{dy}\bigg|_{y_i^{k+1}} \left( \frac{nQ_i^{k+1}}{C_m S_0^{1 / 2} P_i^{k+1}} \right)^{3/5}
$$
Once the flow depth is known, the remaining geometry relations can be computed 
and the algorithm moves to the next downstream node. The algorithm advances to 
the next time step once all nodes are computed.

### Solution to the Dynamic Wave Model: the Lax diffusive scheme

The set of equations describing the DWM are more complex than the KWM, and 
therefore requires more sophisticated numerical solution methods. The Lax 
diffusive scheme is similar to the scheme used for the KWM in terms of the 
model domain discretization and initialization, but requires additional 
computations at each node to obtain the solution.

For an internal (non-boundary) node $i$ on time step $k + 1$, flow values are 
computed through a two step process. First, averages of $A$, $Q$, and the 
inertial term $S = gA\left(S_f - S_0\right)$ are computed for the node, i.e.
$$
A_i^* = \frac{1}{2}\left(A^k_{i+1} + A^k_{i - 1}  \right)
$$
$$
Q^*_i = \frac{1}{2}\left(Q^k_{i+1} + Q^k_{i - 1}  \right)
$$
$$
S_i^* = \frac{1}{2}\left(S^k_{i+1} + S^k_{i - 1}\right) = \frac{gA}{2}\left({S_f}^k_{i + 1}  + {S_f}^k_{i - 1} - 2S_0\right)
$$
The values for node $i$ on time step $k + 1$ are then calculated as
$$
A_i^{k + 1} = A_i^* - \frac{\Delta t}{2\Delta x}\left(Q^k_{i+1} - Q^k_{i-1}\right)
$$
$$
Q_i^{k + 1} = Q_i^* - \frac{\Delta t}{2\Delta x}\left(F^k_{i+1} - F^k_{i-1}\right) -  S_i^*\Delta t
$$
where $F = Qu + g\bar{y}A$. To compute the flow depth $y_i^{k+1}$ from the new 
area $A_i^{k+1}$, the Newton-Raphson method is again applied where
$$
f(y_i^{k+1}) = 0 = A\left(y_i^{k+1}\right) - A_i^{k+1}
$$
and
$$
\frac{df}{dy_i^{k+1}} = \frac{dA}{dy} \bigg|_{y_i^{k+1}}
$$
It is clear from the derivation that unlike the 
KWM solution, both the upstream and the downstream boundary conditions must be 
known at each time step. The MOC described later provides a method for 
predicting, rather than imposing, the downstream boundary condition. 

### Solution to the Dynamic Wave Model: the MacCormack scheme 

The MacCormack scheme is an advanced finite-differencing scheme that provides
high accuracy for considerably coarser spatial and temporal resolutions 
compared to the Lax diffusive scheme. The scheme consists of a 
backwards-looking predictor step followed by a forward-looking corrector step.
The intermediate values calculated in the predictor step are used to develop 
new intermediate values in the corrector step, and these calculations are 
averaged to obtain the final value. The predictor step computes the 
intermediate values at an internal node $i$ as
$$
Q_i^* = Q_i^k - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}\left( F_i - F_{i - 1}\right) - S_i^k \Delta t
$$
$$
A^*_i = A_i^k - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}\left( Q_i^k - Q_{i-1}^k \right)
$$
with intermediate values of $F$ and $S$ ($F^*$ and $S^*$) computed from these 
results. On the corrector step, new values for $Q$ and $A$ are computed as 
$$
Q_i^{**} = Q_i^{k} - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}\left( F^*_{i + 1} - F^*_{i} \right) - S_i^* \Delta t
$$
$$
A_i^{**} = A_i^k - \frac{\Delta t}{\Delta x}\left( Q_{i+1}^* - Q_i^* \right)
$$
The new values for time step $k + 1$ are the arithmetic averages of the 
predictor and corrector step results, i.e.
$Q_i^{k+1} = \frac{1}{2}\left( Q_i^* + Q_i^{**} \right)$ and 
$A_i^{k+1} = \frac{1}{2}\left( A_i^* + A_i^{**} \right)$. The remaining terms 
are then computed from these new values.

### Solutions to boundary conditions: the Method of Characteristics

The DWM solution schemes provided by `rivr` require that both the upstream and
downstream boundary be known. Because the downstream boundary is not known 
*a priori* under many circumstances, the requirement would limit the utility of 
the numerical schemes. The Method of Characteristics (MOC) provides a method 
for predicting the downstream boundary condition at the beginning of each time
step, allowing users to route waves trhough the downstream boundary with 
minimal loss of information. In addition, the method also allows the user to 
specify both the upstream and downstream boundary conditions in terms of either
flow or depth, and allows specification of sudden cessation of 
flow, i.e. closure of a sluice gate at the upstream or downstream boundary.

MOC is a well-known concept with application to a wide variety of numerical 
problems; the general theory is not presented here. It can be shown that 
the upstream boundary condition (node $i = 1$) on time step $k$ can be defined 
as 
$$
u_1^k = \phi_1^0 + \psi_2^0 y_1^k
$$
where
$$
\psi_2^0 = \sqrt{\frac{g}{y_2^0}}
$$
and
$$
\phi_1^0 = u_2^0 - \psi_2^0 + g\left( S_0 - {S_f}_2^0 \right)\Delta t
$$
As seen from these relations, the flow velocity and depth at the upstream 
boundary on any time step $k$ are related to the initial conditions (i.e. 
$k = 0$). The downstream boundary condition (node $i = N$) is similarly 
expressed as
$$
u^k_N = \phi_N^0 - \psi_{N-1}^0 y_N^k
$$
where
$$
\psi^0_{N-1} = \sqrt{\frac{g}{y^0_{N-1}}}
$$
and
$$
\phi^0_{N} = u^0_{N-1} + \psi^0_{N-1} y^0_{N-1} + g\left( S_0 - {S_f}^0_{N-1} \right) \Delta t 
$$
Therefore given either a flow or depth on timestep $k$, the upstream boundary
condition can be computed as long as the initial conditions are known. This is 
a notable improvement over the normal-depth assumption of the upstream 
boundary condition employed in the KWM. Flow can be routed through the 
downstream boundary by assuming the gradient in flow or water level between the
downstream boundary and the nearest internal node is zero (i.e.
$Q^k_N = Q^k_{N-1}$ or $y^k_N = y^k_{N-1}$). This results in "smearing" the 
solution across the downstream boundary but is
often still preferable to direct specification of flow. Specifying the 
downstream boundary as a constant water depth representing i.e. a lake or 
reservoir water level may also be appropriate under many circumstances.
When flow is specified at e.g. the upstream boundary, flow depth and area are 
solved simultaneously using a Newton-Raphson scheme where
$$
f(y_1^k) = Q_1^k - A_1^k \left(\phi_1^0 + \psi_2^0 y_1^k\right) = 0
$$
and
$$
\frac{df}{dy_1^k} = -\frac{dA}{dy}\bigg|_{y_1^k} \left( \phi_1^0 + \psi_2^0 A_1^k + y_1^k \right)
$$
Note that if $Q_1^k = 0$ the flow depth $y_1^k$ can be solved for directly, and
if depth is supplied then the flow can be solved for directly. The solution 
method for the downstream boundary is analogous, noting that the sign of the 
second term in $f(y^k_{N})$ and the corresponding term in its derivative are 
reversed.
